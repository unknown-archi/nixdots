## Cursor theme set up
[Hyprcursor fix](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Hypr-Ecosystem/hyprcursor/)
The cursor theme is set up in hyprland but in order for it to work, download and put:
- This [theme](https://github.com/ndom91/rose-pine-hyprcursor/releases/tag/v0.3.2) in both `/usr/share/themes` and `~/.themes`
- This [theme](https://github.com/rose-pine/cursor/releases/tag/v1.1.0) in both `/usr/share/icons` and `~/.icons`
